              <p class="mb-4">We understand there may be times when your personal circumstances change. You may experience an unexpected event or changes outside of your control like losing your job, suffering an illness or injury, being affected by a natural disaster, or a downturn in your business.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">As a result, if you can’t afford the minimum repayment on your loan or credit card, and would like us to consider if we can provide financial difficulty assistance, please contact us immediately. The sooner you contact us the sooner we can try to help you.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">In many instances help can be provided quickly and efficiently over the phone.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">Otherwise we may need to do a more detailed assessment of your personal and financial circumstances to identify how we might be able to help.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">Financial difficulty assistance is available to you, whether you are an individual, joint account holder, guarantor or small business customer. If you have a joint account and are experiencing financial difficulty, we can assist you individually if you request it.</p>
