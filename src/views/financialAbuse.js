              <p class="mb-4">Financial abuse can come in the form of Elder, Domestic, Disability and/or Language/Cultural abuse.</p>
              <div class="mb-6">
                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Elder</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">Elder financial abuse is a specific form of exploitation. It may also be emotional abuse.</p>
                <p class="mb-2">There are many forms of elder financial abuse, but there is a common thread. In general, it is an effort by unscrupulous person/s to extract money and resources through a variety of devious means from elderly persons.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-2">
                  <li>deceit</li>

                  <li>misuse of a person's Power of Attorney or Guardianship instructions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In general, all involve improper use of an older person’s assets.</p>

              <div class="mb-6">
                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Disability</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">Financial abuse of a disabled person is any act involving the misuse of the person’s money or property. This is done without their full knowledge, consent or understanding.</p>
                <p>This can be against an individual with a physical and/or mental disability. It deprives them of vital financial resources for their personal needs.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="mb-6">
                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Domestic</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">Domestic financial abuse may occur when a person uses money as a means to gain power and control over their partner.</p>
                <p class="mb-2">This type of abuse is when a victim can be trapped in an abusive relationship with the person doing such things as:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-2">
                  <li>forbidding access to bank accounts</li>
                  <li>providing an inadequate allowance</li>
                  <li>not allowing the victim to work</li>
                  <li>forcing the victim to sign documents or make false declarations</li>
                  <li>denying that the victim has an entitlement to joint property.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-2">This is not an exhaustive list.</p>
                <p class="mb-2">This type of financial abuse can be subtle. A person gradually takes control over bank accounts and financial transactions. Domestic financial abuse can also be obvious, violent and threatening.</p>
                <p>It may not be until after a relationship has ended that the customer realizes that they are a victim of financial abuse.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="mb-6">
                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Language/Cultural</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">People who speak little English, including from Indigenous communities, are at an increased risk of financial abuse.</p>
                <p class="mb-2">Due to the difficulties in gaining information about banking services and products, they often trust others to help. This can be a trusted family member or friend, who they use them to interpret for them.</p>
                <p>This can lead to the person becoming a victim of financial abuse without their full understanding of the circumstances.</p>
